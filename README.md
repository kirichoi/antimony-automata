Copyright (c) 2017 Kiri Choi

## Introduction
This is an [Antimony](https://github.com/sys-bio/antimony) representation of Conway's Game of Life.

[gosper_glider.txt](https://github.com/kirichoi/antimony-automata/blob/master/gosper_glider.txt) is a Life 1.06 format representation of Gosper Glider Gun provided as an example.

[antimony_creation.py](https://github.com/kirichoi/antimony-automata/blob/master/antimony_creation.py) reads Life 1.06 format files and translates it into Antimony equilvalent.

[automata.py](https://github.com/kirichoi/antimony-automata/blob/master/automata.py) loads in Antimony model and simulates it to generate set of images.
